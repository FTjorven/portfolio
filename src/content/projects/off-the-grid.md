**Off the Grid — Forgotten Musicians** was an integration assignment where we had to build a fun, functional website for a very specific audience.  
My chosen audience was **forgotten or past-their-prime musicians**, artists who once had a spotlight but have since faded from it.

The goal of my site was to encourage them to go *off the grid* creatively: to reconnect with their art without pressure, algorithms, or expectations.  
The design used nostalgic, analog-inspired visuals paired with modern interactivity, creating a bridge between old and new music culture.

Every part of the site — from the layout to the tone of voice — aimed to feel like an intimate creative retreat.  
It mixed subtle humor, retro textures, and clean digital design to show that going off the grid doesn’t mean being forgotten; it can mean rediscovering yourself.
