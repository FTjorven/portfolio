**Click Festival Showcase** was a project for our **Creative Code** class, focused on learning and applying JavaScript in interactive and expressive ways.  
It wasn’t a visual design assignment, but a coding one where we explored how code can create dynamic visuals, math, and user-driven experiences.

My site brings together nearly everything I learned about JavaScript throughout the course: animations, event interactions, generative visuals, and subtle storytelling.  
Each section showcases a different experiment, all tied into one cohesive digital “festival” experience.

The project encouraged us to think of code as a creative tool rather than just a technical one, blending logic with design intuition.  
It became a kind of living portfolio of everything I had explored during that semester.
