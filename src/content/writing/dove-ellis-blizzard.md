Every year, the first end-of-year lists start appearing in early December. Whether it's because publications want to be ahead of the competition or because they want to start the new year with a clean slate, it remains a fact. Unfortunately, this means that some albums always end up missing from these lists. Last year, that was the fantastic *Heavy Metal* by Cameron Winter, the singer of Geese. A super heavy and masterful album that defined the year. Dove Ellis continues that tradition with this chamber-pop / folk tour-de-force.

Not much is known about Ellis himself. The 22-year-old Galway born artist now based in Manchester has never given an interview. He also doesn't seem very interested in introducing himself. When Ellis uploaded a few songs to Bandcamp in late 2024, a bidding war followed, and he eventually chose a small indie label instead of any of the big label competitors. Speaking of Geese: at their sold-out US tour last year, they brought Ellis along as the opener, where he played his first 'bigger' shows. In contrast, he has only played a handful of headline shows himself. Yet it's exactly that mystique and distance that seem to form part of his appeal.

Despite his limited interest in being a public figure, the hype for this debut album was undeniably strong. With lead single 'To The Sandals' (a reworked version of one of those earlier Bandcamp tracks), Ellis immediately showed that he has 'it'. His voice brings hints of Jeff Buckley, and his approach to songwriting feels as deliberate as someone like a Cameron Winter, who I mentioned earlier.

Across the album's ten songs, Ellis pulls us completely into his own melancholic little world. Although he clearly wears his influences on his sleeve, he still crafts a universe that is unmistakably his own. Take opener 'Little Left Hope', one of the more intimate moments on the record. The track initially evokes a hint of Nick Drake, slowly builds up, and eventually collapses back into silence. Something that happens more than just this one time on the album. 'Jaundice' is the shortest track here and presents a complete shift, with lyrics that read like an old poem and instrumentation that makes you want to dance as if you're at a medieval festival.

The next two tracks, 'Pale Song' and 'Love Is', were released a few weeks ago as a double single and complement each other perfectly. 'Pale Song' continues the fragile atmosphere of the previous track, carried by a soft guitar and a few electronic *refinements*. At first glance, 'Love Is' seems to follow the same direction, but its placement feels almost deliberate to break the pattern and reveal Ellis's range. The song quickly blooms into a warmer and livelier whole.

On 'When You Tie Your Hair Up', Ellis sounds completely defeated and hopeless. This track practically sums up the entire album with its almost otherworldly buildup and vocals. The way his voice moves from whisper-soft to desperately breaking open, while the instrumentation shifts from a single stringed instrument to a broader, airy texture, makes this the emotional center of the record. It feels as if he lays his entire inner world out on the table in that moment.

Throughout the rest of the album, Ellis continues to balance vulnerability and controlled intensity. Songs like 'Heaven Has No Wings' and 'It Is A Blizzard' show how effortlessly he shifts between intimate chamber-folk and the more layered arrangements. At no point does it feel like he overreaches; every instrument, every tiny sound, every vocal choice seems placed with precision to serve the whole. This makes *Blizzard* such a worthwhile listen, it's a really coherent body of work that sinks deeper with every listen. (Which I've done my fair share of over the past few days)

What is absolutely clear on *Blizzard* is that the Manchester-based artist is one to watch. He has found his own sound without losing his spontaneity, and this debut genuinely feels like the start of something much bigger. You hear someone who knows exactly where he wants to go, yet still leaves room to surprise. If Ellis continues along this path, he could very well become another artist who shapes the rest of this decade.
