                <p>
                    On this page, I’d like to show you some of my work — small
                    projects, creative experiments, and assignments that helped
                    shape how I think about design and code. I’m presenting them
                    chronologically.

                        My first visual design assignment, imagining a digital
                        world filled with forgotten data — old files, obsolete
                        formats, and memories from the early internet. A world
                        of decay, nostalgia, and rediscovery.

                        A four-part Creative Code project built in p5.js
                        exploring visual contrast through movement, rhythm, and
                        emotion. Each animation represents one side of a duality
                        — chaos and order, light and dark.
