                    On this page, I’d like to show you some of my work — small
                    projects, creative experiments, and assignments that helped
                    shape how I think about design and code. I’m presenting them
                    chronologically.

                        A two-part p5.js animation exploring contrast in motion
                        and color. “Chaos” uses fluid and unpredictable
                        movement, while “Order” transitions into a structured
                        checkerboard. Together they reflect balance between
                        control and freedom.

                        A storytelling website built around the idea of reusing
                        playing cards for a retro, speakeasy-inspired
                        experience. It mixes writing, interaction, and nostalgia
                        with modern web techniques.

                        A personal showcase project combining many of my
                        JavaScript experiments into one cohesive experience. It
                        reflects my learning journey through motion,
                        interactivity, and playful design.
