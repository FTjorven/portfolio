                My name is {name}. I’m currently studying {occupation}. I have a
                passion for visual and auditory arts but I also love the coding
                and UX parts of the process. On this page I’d just like to show
                who I am a little better.

            <h3>more to come...?</h3>
            <p>
                Besides my work in Web Design, I’m very passionate about music
                and live shows. I’m currently working on getting more into my
                local music scene. I work at a concert venue in Kortrijk and
                often write about music, which you can find in the writing
                section of my page.
