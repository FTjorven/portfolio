                    My name is {name}. I’m currently studying {occupation}. I
                    have a passion for visual and auditory arts but I also love
                    the coding and UX parts of the process. On this page I’d
                    just like to show who I am a little better.

                    Besides my work in Web Design, I’m very passionate about
                    music and liveshows. I’m currently working on getting more
                    into my local music scene. I work at a concert venue in
                    Kortrijk and often write about music, which you can find in
                    the writing section of my page.
