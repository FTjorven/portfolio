**Land of Lost Files** was my take on the *Land of Lost and Found* assignment — my first visual design project at Devine.

The concept focused on the forgotten corners of the internet: deleted folders, obsolete file types, and half-finished creations buried deep in old desktops.  
I imagined a digital world where these lost files continued to exist — floating through pixelated landscapes, trying to find relevance again.

The visual design reflected that feeling of digital decay and nostalgia.  
Textures mimicked compression artifacts and glitch patterns, while color choices drew from early web aesthetics — cyan blues, dull greys, and sharp neon accents.  

This assignment taught me how to use visual storytelling to build a world from a single idea — and how even the most obsolete things can still feel alive when given attention.
