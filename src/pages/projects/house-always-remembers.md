**The House Always Remembers** was my second integration project, where we had to create a storytelling website that promotes three creative reuses for a common household object.  
I chose **playing cards** — transforming them into the foundation of a retro-inspired house party experience.

The concept invites visitors into a speakeasy-style world where every card has a story to tell.  
It blends interactive storytelling with sustainability, showing how old decks can be repurposed for new memories: from themed invitations to cocktail ideas and DIY games.

Visually, the site combines **casino glamour** with **DIY charm**, warm colours, layered textures, and playful animations all tied together in a cohesive narrative tone.  
It’s both elegant and a little mischievous, much like the parties it imagines.
