				<h2>Welcome to my portfolio</h2>
				<p>
					This website is a collection of the projects, experiments,
					and ideas that reflect what I enjoy creating. Youll&#39;
					find a mix of design, development, and personal writing.
					Each piece shows a little part of how I think and what I
					like to make.
				</p>

				<p>
					I&#39;m interested in how visuals, sound, and interaction
					can come together to make meaningful experiences. Whether
					it&#39;s coding something dynamic, designing a playful
					interface, or writing about music, I enjoy exploring how all
					of these connect.
				</p>

				<p>
					Feel free to look around — my
					<a href="/projects">projects</a> page features some of my recent
					design and web experiments, while the
					<a href="/writing">writing</a> section includes thoughts and
					pieces about music and creativity.
