			<h2>Welcome to my portfolio</h2>
			<p>
				This website is a collection of the projects, experiments, and
				ideas that reflect what I enjoy creating. You&#39;ll find a mix
				of design, development, and personal writing. Each piece shows a
				little part of how I think and what I like to make.
			</p>

			<p>
				I&#39;m interested in how visuals, sound, and interaction can
				come together to make meaningful experiences. Whether it&#39;s
				coding something dynamic, designing a playful interface, or
				writing about music, I enjoy exploring how all of these connect.
			</p>

			<p>
				Feel free to look around — my <a href="/projects">projects</a> page
				features some of my recent design and web experiments, while the
				<a href="/writing">writing</a> section includes thoughts and pieces
				about music and creativity.
